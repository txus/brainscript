#brainscript

Brainscript is a scripting language that compiles to clean, readable Brainfuck.

This project is inspired by Jeremy Ashkenas' [CoffeeScript](https://github.com/jashkenas/coffee-script).

Its purpose is to demonstrate some of the architectural principles specified
in the FTL specification. Also, FTL stands for *for the lulz*.

Brainscript is currently under intensive development. It certainly does **not** work.

##Under the hood

Run the test suite by typing:

    rake

You can also build the documentation with the following command:

    rake docs

## Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history. (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send us a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
